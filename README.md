## Hello World ! 🧚‍♀️

### 🌸 I’m an undergraduate at UMass Amherst interested in game development + the intersection between finance and computer science. I love playing video games, reading, and watching films. I mainly post Python scripts, but I have a few projects I've completed during previous semesters-- this does not include the unified question answering system research I did the entirety of my sophomore year.
