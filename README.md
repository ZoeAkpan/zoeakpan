## Hello World! ðŸŒŽ

### ðŸŒ¸ Iâ€™m an undergraduate at UMass Amherst interested in game development + the intersection between finance and computer science. I love playing video games, reading, and watching films. I mainly post Python scripts, but I have a few projects I've completed during previous semesters-- not including the unified question answering system research I did the entirety of my sophomore year.
